      # This API gathers information about an access token.
      # ### Description
      # This API is supposed to be called from within the implementations of protected resource endpoints
      # of the authorization server implementation in order to get information about the access token which
      # was presented by the client application.
      # In general, a client application accesses a protected resource endpoint of a service with an access
      # token, and the implementation of the endpoint checks whether the presented access token has enough
      # privileges (= scopes) to access the protected resource before returning the protected resource to
      # the client application. To achieve this flow, the endpoint implementation has to know detailed
      # information about the access token. Authlete `/auth/introspection` API can be used to get such information.
      # The response from `/auth/introspection` API has some parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter
      # that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action
      # that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the
      # authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.
      # **INTERNAL\_SERVER\_ERROR**
      # When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL\_SERVER\_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
      # server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
      # In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
      # Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
      # HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error". Authlete recommends `application/json` as the content
      # type although OAuth 2.0 specification does not mention the format of the error response when the
      # redirect URI is not usable.
      # The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of
      # [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if
      # the protected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client
      # application in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
      # parameter of the service is Bearer), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
      # `WWW-Authenticate` header.
      # The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.
      # ```
      # HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
      # Content-Type: application/json
      # Cache-Control: no-store
      # Pragma: no-cache
      # {responseContent}
      # ```
      # **BAD\_REQUEST**
      # When the value of `action` is `BAD\_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
      # does not contain an access token (= the request from the authorization server implementation to
      # Authlete does not contain `token` request parameter).
      # A response with HTTP status of "400 Bad Request" must be returned to the client application and
      # the content type must be `application/json`.
      # The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
      # 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the
      # protected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client
      # application in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
      # parameter of the service is `Bearer`), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
      # `WWW-Authenticate` header.
      # The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.
      # ```
      # HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
      # WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
      # Cache-Control: no-store
      # Pragma: no-cache
      # ```
      # **UNAUTHORIZED**
      # When the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the access token does not exist or has
      # expired.
      # The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of RFC
      # 6750 (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the protected resource of the service implementation
      # wants to return an error response to the client application in the way that complies with [RFC
      # 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
      # parameter of the service is `Bearer`), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
      # `WWW-Authenticate` header.
      # The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.
      # ```
      # HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
      # WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
      # Cache-Control: no-store
      # Pragma: no-cache
      # ```
      # **FORBIDDEN**
      # When the value of `action` is `FORBIDDEN`, it means that the access token does not cover the required
      # scopes or that the subject associated with the access token is different from the subject contained
      # in the request.
      # A response with HTTP status of "400 Bad Request" must be returned to the client application and
      # the content type must be `application/json`.
      # The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
      # 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the
      # protected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client
      # application in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
      # parameter of the service is Bearer), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
      # `WWW-Authenticate` header.
      # The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.
      # ```
      # HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
      # WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
      # Cache-Control: no-store
      # Pragma: no-cache
      # ```
      # **OK**
      # When the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that the access token which the client application
      # presented is valid (= exists and has not expired).
      # The implementation of the protected resource endpoint is supposed to return the protected resource
      # to the client application.
      # When action is `OK`, the value of `responseContent` is `"Bearer error=\"invalid\_request\""`. This
      # is the simplest string which can be used as the value of `WWW-Authenticate` header to indicate
      # "400 Bad Request". The implementation of the protected resource endpoint may use this string to
      # tell the client application that the request was bad (e.g. in case necessary request parameters
      # for the protected resource endpoint are missing). However, in such a case, the implementation
      # should generate a more informative error message to help developers of client applications.
      # The following is an example error response which complies with RFC 6750.
      # ```
      # HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
      # WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
      # Cache-Control: no-store
      # Pragma: no-cache
      # ```
      # Basically, The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of
      # [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage). So, if
      # the service has selected `Bearer` as the value of `accessTokenType` configuration parameter, the
      # value of `responseContent` can be used directly as the value of `WWW-Authenticate` header. However,
      # if the service has selected another different token type, the service has to generate error messages
      # for itself.
      # \_**JWT-based access token**\_
      # Since version 2.1, Authlete provides a feature to issue access tokens in JWT format. This feature
      # can be enabled by setting a non-null value to the `accessTokenSignAlg` property of the service
      # (see the description of the Service class for details). `/api/auth/introspection` API can accept
      # access tokens in JWT format. However, note that the API does not return information contained in
      # a given JWT-based access token but returns information stored in the database record which corresponds
      # to the given JWT-based access token. Because attributes of the database record can be modified
      # after the access token is issued (for example, by using `/api/auth/token/update` API), information
      # returned by `/api/auth/introspection` API and information the given JWT-based access token holds
      # may be different.

      # with [RFC 7662](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662) (OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection).
      # ### Description
      # This API is supposed to be called from within the implementations of the introspection endpoint
      # of your service. The authorization server implementation should retrieve the value of `action` from
      # the response and take the following steps according to the value.
      # In general, a client application accesses a protected resource endpoint of a service with an access
      # token, and the implementation of the endpoint checks whether the presented access token has enough
      # privileges (= scopes) to access the protected resource before returning the protected resource to
      # the client application. To achieve this flow, the endpoint implementation has to know detailed
      # information about the access token. Authlete `/auth/introspection` API can be used to get such information.
      # The response from `/auth/introspection` API has some parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter
      # that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action
      # that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the
      # authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.
      # **INTERNAL\_SERVER\_ERROR**
      # When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL\_SERVER\_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
      # server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
      # In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
      # Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
      # HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error".
      # The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
      # as the entity body of the response if you want. Note that, however, [RFC 7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662) does not mention anything about the response
      # body of error responses.
      # The following illustrates an example response which the introspection endpoint of the authorization
      # server implementation generates and returns to the client application.
      # ```
      # HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
      # Content-Type: application/json
      # {responseContent}
      # ```
      # **BAD\_REQUEST**
      # When the value of `action` is `BAD\_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
      # is invalid. This happens when the request from the client did not include the token request parameter.
      # See "[2.1. Introspection Request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662#section-2.1)" in
      # RFC 7662 for details about requirements for introspection requests.
      # The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application should be "400 Bad Request".
      # The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
      # as the entity body of the response if you want. Note that, however, [RFC 7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662)
      # does not mention anything about the response body of error responses.
      # The following illustrates an example response which the introspection endpoint of the authorization
      # server implementation generates and returns to the client application.
      # ```
      # HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
      # Content-Type: application/json
      # {responseContent}
      # ```
      # **OK**
      # When the value of `action` is `OK`, the request from the client application is valid.
      # The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be "200 OK" and its content
      # type must be `application/json`.
      # The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which complies with the introspection response
      # defined in "2.2. Introspection Response" in RFC7662.
      # The following illustrates the response which the introspection endpoint of your authorization server
      # implementation should generate and return to the client application.
      # ```
      # HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      # Content-Type: application/json
      # {responseContent}
      # ```
      # Note that RFC 7662 says \_"To prevent token scanning attacks, **the endpoint MUST also require some
      # form of authorization to access this endpoint**"\_. This means that you have to protect your introspection
      # endpoint in some way or other. Authlete does not care about how your introspection endpoint is protected.
      # In most cases, as mentioned in RFC 7662, "401 Unauthorized" is a proper response when an introspection
      # request does not satisfy authorization requirements imposed by your introspection endpoint.
