      # JweAlg - this is the 'alg' header value for encrypted JWT tokens.
      # Depending upon the context, this refers to key transport scheme to be used by the client and by the server. For instance:
      # - as `authorizationEncryptionAlg` value, it refers to the encoding algorithm used by server for transporting they keys on JARM objects
      # - as `requestEncryptionAlg` value, it refers to the expected key transport encoding algorithm that server expect from client when encrypting a Request Object
      # - as `idTokenEncryptionAlg` value, it refers to the algorithm used by the server to key transport of id_tokens
      # 
      # **Please note that some of the algorithms are more secure than others, some are not supported very well cross platforms and some (like RSA1_5) is known to be weak**.
